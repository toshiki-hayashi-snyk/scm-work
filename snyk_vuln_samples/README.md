# Snyk Vulnerability Test Samples

This archive contains three sample projects intentionally including vulnerabilities to trigger Snyk PR checks (security, license, code).

- security-node: vulnerable npm deps + Dockerfile
- license-maven: Maven project with GPL-like dependency
- code-js: Node.js app with SQLi, command injection, and reflected XSS

Use these only in a controlled/testing environment.
